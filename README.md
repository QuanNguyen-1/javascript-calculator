# javascript-calculator
This is a calculator web application made using React, HTML, and Javascript. This calculator includes buttons for numbers 0-9, math operations +, -, /, *, and functions percentage, decimal, +/-, equal, and AC. The calculator adds all the inputs into an expression and returns an answer only when the equal button is pressed. After equal is pressed and an answer is returned, it is possible to continue adding math operations to that answer and continue the computation. If the input is too large for the display, an error message occurs.
